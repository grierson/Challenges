= Problem

Given `[1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0]`

You need to arrange them in a 3 x 3 matrix so that:

. The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
. The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
. The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number

== What do we know (What properties)?

* 9 numbers
* One row/column has to contain `5` so lowest possible is [1 1.5 5] = 7.5
* One row/column has to contain `1` so highest possible is [1 4.5 5] = 10.5

== Steps
