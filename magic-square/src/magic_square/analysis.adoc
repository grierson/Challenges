What do we know (What properties)?

- 9 numbers
- Lowest column/row permutation: [1 1.5 2.0] = 4
- Highest column/row permutation: [4 4.5 5.0] = 13.5
- Biggest + smallest is 6, except middle (3)
|===
| Small | Big | Result
| 1 | 5 | 6
| 1.5 | 4.5 | 6
| 2 | 4.0 | 6
| 2.5 | 3.5 | 6
| 3 | _ | 3
|===
- Sum of numbers is = (+ 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5) = (/ (* 9 (+ 1 5)) 2) = 27
