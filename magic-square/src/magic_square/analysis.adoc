= Problem

Given `[1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0]`

You need to arrange them in a 3 x 3 matrix so that:

. The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
. The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
. The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number

== What do we know (What properties)?

* 9 numbers

=== Min/Max
Original assumption

* Min: `[1 1.5 2]` = 4.5
* Max: `[4 4.5 5]` = 13.5

However One row/column has to contain `1` and one has to contain `5` so

* Min: `[1 1.5 5]` = 7.5
* Max: `[1 4.5 5]` = 10.5

Following on from that

* Min (`[1 1.5 5]`)
** The second row lowest would be `[2 2.5 3]` = 7.5
** Leaving the third row with `[3.5 4 4.5]` = 12
* Max (`[1 4.5 5]`)
** The second row maximum would be `[3 3.5 4]` = 10.5
** Leaving third row with `[1.5 2 2.5]` = 6

So the magic number must be `(and (> magic 7.5) (< magic 10.5))`

* Gone from a difference of (- 13.5 4.5) => 9
* To a difference of (- 10.5 7.5) => 3
