== Part 1

Turn on lights

=== Attempt one

Map every light within a 2d array like a grid system

[source,clojure]
----
[[true false true]
 [false false true]
 [false false false]]
----

`get-in` to read index
`update-in` to set index

* [0 0] = true
* [1 1] = false
* [2 2] = false
* [1 2] = true

Then flatten and count the amount of true values

==== Result

.06_1.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(time (amount-on (reduce update-state (make-grid 1000 1000) data)))
"Elapsed time: 6052.091546 msecs"
=> 377891
----

Takes 6 seconds, can we improve it?

=== Attempt two - Use set

Keep all turned on light within a set and just count the set.

* Turn on = `set/union`
* Turn off = `set/difference`
* Toggle = `turn on` and `turn off`

==== Result

I've managed to make the performance much worse!
But used less code by using `clojure.set`

.06_2.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(time (amount-on (reduce update-state (make-grid 1000 1000) data)))
"Elapsed time: 24000.103346 msecs"
=> 377891
----

== Part 2

* Toggle on = + 1
* Toggle off = - 1 (minimum of 0)
* Toggle = + 2

=== Attempt 1 - One big hashmap

Store each index in hash map and add/sub from that key

.Plan
[source,clojure]
----
(def state {[0 0] 2
            [0 1] 9
            [0 2] 0})

(reduce + (vals state))
----

==== Result

Slow but it works

.06_3.clj
[source,clojure]
----
(time (total (reduce update-state {} data)))
"Elapsed time: 25717.341518 msecs"
=> 14110788
