= Two Number Sum

* Found two numbers = sum -> [x, y]
* None -> []

[source, python]
----
numbers = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
target = 10

=> [-1, 11]
----

== Solution 1

Just foreach over the list twice.

[source, python]
----
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
    for a in array:
        for b in array[1:]:
            if a + b == targetSum:
                return [a, b]

    return []

# => [5, 5]
----

=== Solution 1 - Problem - Need to skip index
`5` getting read twice need to skip index in second loop.


[source, python]
----
def twoNumberSum(array, targetSum):
    for idx, val in enumerate(array):
        for b in array[0:idx] + array[idx+1:]:
            if val + b == targetSum:
              return [val, b]
           
    return []

# => [11, -1]
----

=== Solution 1 - Passed
