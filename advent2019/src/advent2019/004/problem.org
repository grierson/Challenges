* Problem 
  How many passwords?

** Constraints
  - 6 digits
  - Within range of `234,208 - 765,869`
  - Two digits are adjacent
  - Left->Right Digits `never decrease`

** What do we know
   - Star range is actually `234,444` as digits can't decrease
   - End range is actully `699,999` as digits can't decrease
     - As number start with 7 and 77x,xxx would be over the max `765,869`
     - Then have to look at next consecutive number which would be 699,999
   - Pair can't be `1` or `2`
     - `1` is less than `2` which is first numbers in start range `234,444`
     - Can't be `2` as start range is `234,444` which is greater than `222,222` and all consecutive values would have to be greater than 2
