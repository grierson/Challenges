* Problem 
  How many passwords?

** Constraints
  - 6 digits
  - Within range of `234,208 - 765,869`
  - Two digits are adjacent
  - Left->Right Digits `never decrease`

** What do we know
   - Star range is actually `234,444` as digits can't decrease
   - End range is actully `699,999` as digits can't decrease
     - As number start with 7 and 77x,xxx would be over the max `765,869`
     - Then have to look at next consecutive number which would be 699,999
