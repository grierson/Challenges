== Glossary

* Intcode - list of integers separated by commas `1,0,0,3,99`
* opcode - Index of operation to perform
** Add (1), Multiple (2), Halt (99)
* Instruction (Own term)
** `0,1,2,3`
** `[opcode (get number at index 1) (get number at index 2) (store result at index 3)]`

=== opcode

* Perform opcode on two following index values, Store value at index
** `[1 0 0 1]` => `[opcode num1 num2 store]`

[source,clojure]
----
(let [opcode (get 1 opcodes) ;; => +
      num1 (get 0 intcode)   ;; => 1
      num2 (get 0 intcode)   ;; => 1
      result (opcode num1 num2)] ;; => (+ 1 1) => 2
    (assoc intcode 1 result)) ;; => [1 2 0 1]
----

For example, if your Intcode computer encounters `1,10,20,30`,
it should read the values at positions `10` and `20`, add those values,
and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.

* Once performed operation jump to next `instruction` (next four intcodes)
