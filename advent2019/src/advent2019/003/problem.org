* Problem

Two wires connected to central port
Trace each wire leaving central port (One wire per line of text)

Using manhatten distance 
find the closest overlap of the wires to the central 

X + Y = Distance

** Constraints 
   - Wire crossing it's self does not count
   - Overlap at central port does not count
   
** Solution
   - Draw wire 1
     - Record each posistion of wire 1 (Central port is 0)
   - Draw wire 2
     - Record each posistion of wire 2 (Central port is 0)
   - Overlaps
     - If location within both then store in overlaps
   - Find closest
     - map (comp abs +) overlaps
